# Diagnostic Center - Simple Hospital Management System -


## How to Run

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/abdulmominmooncse/hospital-management-system](https://github.com/abdulmominmooncse/diagnostic-startup-app)
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
An administrator has to be signed in. Like Dr. Management, he has complete control over the application. Method of payment, service management, and patient management.  

 In order to give services, a doctor needs to be logged in. He can choose the day and time of his duty. In addition, he can offer services both online and offline and write a blog. To receive service, a user needs to be logged in. He is able to schedule appointments and use both online and offline services. He can pay online as well.  

I have utilized Next, React, React Router Dom, Material UI, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JSX, ES6, Node JS, Express JS, and other technologies for both the frontend and backend. I have utilized Firebase, JWT tokens, and MongoDB for database administration, authentication, and hosting.
